# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Background/Problem
Automobile accidents are the number one leading cause of deaths in the United States with over 35,000 people dying from accidents each year and medical/productivity costs exceeding 75 billion dollars per year(CDC). Approximately 22 percent of all accidents are weather-related (Federal Highway Administration). This project aims to address this problem by predicting what factors determine the severity of accidents to provide avenues for possible solutions.

## 1.3 Interest
This project is of particular importance not just to citizens (drivers) but to emergency services, the Federal Highway Administration, as well as new age driving related companies such as Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, etc. to minimize medical and productivity costs resulting from automobile accidents.

# 2. Data
## 2.1 Data Source/Description
To solve this problem, we are using a set of data from Seattle Washington, collected between the years of 2004-2020. This is a labelled dataset with "Accident Severity" as the outcome and contains 37 attributes including the weather conditions and timing (day of the week, time of day) at which the accident occured. A table of the attributes and their type can be seen below.

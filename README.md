# Introduction/Buisness Problem
Problem: You want to determine the collision severity risk of driving during specific weather conditions, time of day, and day of the week. This is particularly useful for driving companies (i.e Uber, Lyft) to determine when they should increase their rates (i.e increased risk to driver, longer delays, etc.).

# Data
The dataset we are using to address this question is collision data from the Seattle, WA area describing severity of collision along with many other attributes of the collision.
